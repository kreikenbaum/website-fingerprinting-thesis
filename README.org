* Defending against Tor Website Fingerprinting with Selective Cover Traffic
** Why
The anonymity network Tor is under attack. It provides access to an
uncensored internet for people in oppressive regimes, and enables for
example whistleblowers to report wrongdoing with no fear of
retribution. If its anonymity were to be reduced, this would hamper
its purpose, both in actual terms, and because this would dissuade
users, as the number of users increase its anonymity.


Website fingerprinting can allow a local passive adversary, a very
limited attacker, to fathom which websites a user is visiting,
reducing Torâ€™s anonymity. This has continued to improve as AI
continues to improve, and researchers publish new website
fingerprinting attacks against Tor.


This repository presents a new defense against website fingerprinting. The
defense creates camouflage traffic tailored to WWW distributions to
hide which page the user visits. It is easily configurable for the
level of required anonymity, and does not burden the user overly,
neither in installation, nor in the time and size delay it imposes.

If you want all the details and history, the complete thesis repo is at https://github.com/kreikenbaum/wfcomplete. The data files are at https://drive.google.com/open?id=13qM-OuX4RZMhsFbjKKW5ZfoXJIYGSkrI (8GB zipped, more than 20GB unzipped). After downloading, do a =zpaq extract data.zpaq=. [[https://github.com/zpaq/zpaq][Zpaq]] keeps the file size down so that it fits on the free Google Drive quota (thank you @Google for hosting this :-)).
